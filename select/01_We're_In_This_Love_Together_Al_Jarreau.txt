It's like a diamond ring
It's a precious thing
And we never want to lose it
It's like a favorite song that we love to sing
Ev'ry time we hear the music

And we're in this love together
We got the kind that lasts forever
We're in this love together
And like berries on the vine
It gets sweeter all the time

It's like a rainy night and candlelight
And ooh, it's so romantic
We got the whole thing working out so right
And it's just the way we planned it, do do

We're in this love together
We got the kind that lasts forever
Don't you know, that,
We're in this love together
And like berries on the vine
It gets sweeter all the time

You know we're in this love together
We got the kind that lasts forever
We're in this love together
We got a kind that will last forever and evermore

Don't you know we're in this love together
We got the kind that lasts forever
Singing out, we're in this love together
We're gonna find that the love has opened up the door, hey yeah yeh
Don't you know that,
We're in this love together
We've got the kind that brings to mind a favorite song
Let me say that,
We're in this love together
We got the kind that blazes all night long, yeh yeh yeh yeh
We're in this love together
